Installation
============

** Cinnamon/GNOME/LXDE/MATE/Unity/Xfce ***

Put this (extracted) folder in '~/.local/share/icons/' (create the last folder "icons" if it doesn't exist; here '~' is your home). In some (outdated) distros the icons directory may be '~/.icons/' instead of '~/.local/share/icons/'.
